How can you use Python? 

* Create a script with any text editor or IDE
     python scriptname.py

     Saves script for reuse
     Best for larger projects
     Best for creating modules/packages/frameworks for re-use

     Best for sysadmin scripts and other general utility scripts

* Use a REPL (ipython or python)
    ipython
    or
    python

    Does NOT save script for reuse
    Great for testing code/experimenting

* Use a Jupyter Notebook (with JupyterLab)
    Can save a notebook
    Saves code, output and graphics
    Has fancy documentation (styled text etc)

    Harder for larger projects
    Not the tool for creating libraries for other code to use
